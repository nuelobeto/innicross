              <p>
                Marketing and sales is very different from promotion and
                advertisement in the creative space just as every other
                business. We deploy marketing and PR campaigns that drive real
                time conversions on digital music platforms for Talents and
                Entities whose target audience are music lovers. We deploy
                marketing campaigns via several platforms which targets both
                local and international audience using several technology
                platforms that identifies target audience.
